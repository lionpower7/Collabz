An app to connect all those who want to collaborate with other people to learn anything they want to!

They first sign up to use our app. After that we present them a list of the different fields such as construction, investing, web development & etc...

After they pick there desired fields they will be automatically grouped to a commumity that they desired and will be able to chat to people after they added them to their friends list to then collab with them.

When you add your "Study Buddy" you can not tell where exactly he/she live, just a hint of where you live for example i live in bronx, NY.

You speak to the person you want to collab with and see his/her skill level in the field!

We would first give them questions to answer to build their skill level/resume. Just a few simple questions.

User will be able to create their own category of their interest.They will be able to customize their projects/plans.
- Projects Will be visible to your study buddy only.
Users can create projects for their friends/community, and they can work on it.

Price to do so is absolutely free!

Users will be able to collect points for their different achievements.

Those Points can get them different prizes.

So we can potentially reward the users who achieve something , by giving them money , stickers, gift cards, profile pictures, etc...

We will not be liable if anything bad happens to those who want to collab with other random people! That will go under terms and conditions! 

Note: We should have legal help to secure our organization(App).

It Should be Different than meetup.com !
